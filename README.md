# Home media server

Powered by qbittorrent and plex.

**Info you should be aware of**

Both plex and qbittorrent have a mounted folder "/media" where all media should reside.
While initially configuring plex, set up all libraries inside "/media".
While configuring qbittorrent - set default download location somewhere inside "/media".
This way plex will be able to see files, downloaded by qbittorrent.
